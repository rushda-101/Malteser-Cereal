**<u>Purpose of the project:</u>**
The primary objective of the website is to create a website for users aged 18 or over to be able to view a large menu of doughnuts ranging from different flavours, sizes and 
shapes, all from the comfort of a screen. The design of the website aims to be aesthetic and coordinated colour scheme as well as visual aids (pictures/icons) to help 
complement the user’s experience.


**<u>Value it provides to the users:</u>**
User Persona 1 - Simon Denzel
This website is designed with the target user, Simon Denzel, a 35-year-old office professional known for organizing top-tier treats for workplace events. Simon values quality
and pays attention to detail, so the site delivers a clean, professional browsing experience with no pop-ups or intrusive ads. It offers clearly labeled products with full 
allergy and dietary information tags, catering to Simon’s preference for transparency and safety. A dedicated bulk-buy section and straightforward cost breakdowns support
his need to plan for larger groups, while optional discounts and bundle deals add value. Every element is designed to match Simon’s expectations for clarity, professionalism and quality.

User Persona 2 - Zainab Hassan
The website also caters to Zainab Hassan, a 21-year-old Psychology student who often rewards herself with sweet treats after a long, stressful week of university.
Zainab is drawn to visually appealing, Instagram-worthy products, so the website features bold and bright colours, playful design elements that reflect her energy and taste.
Product images are styled to be vibrant and aesthetic, perfect for sharing online. Since Zainab tends to skim content, key features like vegan options are clearly labelled
with bold headings and eye-catching visuals. The homepage highlights current deals and discounts, and engaging features like pop-ups or banners are used to guide her quickly
to trending or personalized offers. With minimal clicks to reach what she wants, the site ensures a smooth, fun, and visually delightful experience that fits seamlessly into
her fast-paced, social-media lifestyle.

**<u>Development Process:</u>**
Whilst developing my website, I decided to make a few changes to the wireframe in order to cater the user's needs further and increase the overall accessibility of the
website.

On the homepage, I decided to add a 'Help' button, which when clicked on, loads up a new wireframe that contains user guides, FAQ's and contact support. Adding a ‘Help’
button on the homepage enhances user experience by providing immediate access to essential support resources in one central place, reducing user frustration and improving
usability.

I also updated the 'track order' wireframe. The new design layout is more cohesive and clear, and includes a visual icon to indicate the payment process, providing a smoother
user experience.

This is the new addition to the wireframes, the 'help' wireframe. Adding a 'Help' wireframe improves user experience by offering guidance, reducing frustration, and supporting self-service, especially for new or confused users.

**<u>Setting up and running the project:</u>**
After loading the website, you will be initially directed to the homepage. At the top of the page, there are buttons available to click on.
To load the menu, click on the 'Menu' button to load up the menu wireframe. When on the wireframe, there are + and - buttons underneath each menu option. To add an item, click on the '+' or to decrease the quantity, click on the '-' button.
To load the checkout, click on the 'Track Order' button. 
If you need any help, click on the 'Help'. Here, you are able to view any Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's) by clicking on the specific box you would like to view. If you would like to contact support, enter your email address and your message, then click 'Send' to send your message. Hold and drag the edge of the box to expand it's size on 'Contact Support'.
To load up the homepage again, click on 'Home'.


**<u>Manual Testing:</u>**
Initially, there were issues with the positioning of the + and - button. In order to debug and view what was wrong with the positioning, I added the code:
background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.2); and background-color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 0.2);, in order to highlight the clickable areas and therefore adjust the positions accordingly.
